This Plugin allows craftbukkit server admins access to the server console using SSHv2 protocol - the same protocol that serves as the secure foundation for nearly all remote server administration.

# Why should I use SshConsole ? #

  * Your server runs on Windows.
  * You are in a shared hosting environment that only gives you access to the log files.
  * You want to share access to your server console, but don't want to give anybody access to the machine its running on.
  * You always wanted to use RCON, but want to see the server log as well.
  * You are tired of running your server in a Screen session.
